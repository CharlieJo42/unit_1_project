"Treasure Hunt" is a scaled-down version of the classic "Minesweeper" game. 

151 buttons are laid out in a grid pattern and rendered transparent in order to bring up the background image of an old pirate's map. This is to create the illusion that you are holding the map and trying to figure out where to go, one button click at a time. 

The buttons are coded to be different colors, each with a specific meaning:

*blue for water
*brown for sand
*green for grass/forestry 
*red for the trail to the treasure

but be careful!

*black squares represent the pirates who will do anything to stop you from finding that treasure! If you come across any of them, it's game over and time to walk the plank.
